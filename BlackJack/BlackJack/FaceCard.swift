//Create a new Swift file called FaceCard, create an enum of the same name that has a jack, queen and king case.
//Make the raw value a String.
//Assign the jack case "ðŸŽƒ", queen case "ðŸ‘¸" and king "ðŸ¤´"
//Make sure your enum conforms to CaseIterable in order for the newDeck() method to work.
import Foundation

enum FaceCard: String, CaseIterable {
    case jack =
    case queen
    case king
    
}
